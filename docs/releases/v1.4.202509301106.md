### ✨ Highlights
- Story Outline Overview — dedicated outline workspace with chapter/scene search, inline editing, copy-all export, and quick jump into the editor. Supports AI-powered title & summary updates per scene with model selection.
- Outline → Scene Generation — brand-new modal for generating full scenes from outline notes. Includes customizable prompt templates, codex context inclusion, 25k-word targets, iterative continuation, progress/cancel controls, and request aborts across all AI providers.
- Story Research Workbench — per-scene research tasks with concurrency control, live progress, token estimates, saved histories, and provider-aware prompts. Results link back to the editor so you can highlight and revise prose instantly.
- Scene Chat Memory — keep up to five chat sessions per story, edit earlier prompts, branch new conversations, resend from any message, and manage sessions with a quick-switch modal.

### 🤖 AI Workflow Upgrades
- Favorite model lists can now be centrally managed in Settings and referenced across Beat AI, summaries, and scene generation flows. Story-level favorites persist with each story.
- Scene summaries respect story language and target word-count settings, with sanitized prompts to avoid HTML artifacts.
- AI Rewrite modal reuses the shared Model Selector, remembering local choices while honoring global defaults.
- Story research concurrency is configurable, enabling faster multi-scene analysis without overloading providers.

### 🧠 Inspector & Editor Improvements
- New Character Consistency analyzer in the Story Inspector, alongside the existing cliché review. Findings jump directly to highlighted prose in the editor with a flash indicator for quick orientation.
- Empty drafts now warn before leaving: the Story Editor adds a CanDeactivate guard, beforeunload prompt, and save confirmation to prevent accidental loss.

### 🛠️ Fixes & UX Polish
- Beat AI reliability improvements: synchronized context before generation, safer regenerate sequencing, HTML entity decoding, and guarded delete actions.
- Outline views refined for mobile—transparent styling, spacing fixes, fullscreen content height, and clearer action button sizing.
- Manual CouchDB sync now surfaces progress and failure states in the UI.
- Story summaries and favorites mark unsaved changes correctly; Beat model favorites persist with the story.
- Prompt handling now strips Beat AI markup from summaries/titles to prevent noisy AI input.
