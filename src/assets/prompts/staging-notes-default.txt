# Instructions

## Task
Extract staging notes describing the CURRENT STATE at the end of this content. This content represents everything written BEFORE the next story beat - your notes will help maintain continuity for what comes next.

## Important
- Only describe the final/current state at the END of this content
- Do NOT describe how things changed or evolved - only the current state
- Omit any details that are no longer relevant (e.g., if a character left, don't include them)
- Include only what matters for continuing the narrative from this point

## Focus Areas
- Character positions (where each character currently is in the space)
- Character proximity (note if characters are close together or distant from each other, when relevant for the narrative)
- Character clothing and appearance (state important/distinctive features concisely - e.g., "wearing a torn red dress, barefoot" - skip generic details)
- Character states (posture, what they're holding, emotional demeanor if visible)
- Object placements (relevant items and where they are now)
- Environmental details (current lighting, weather, time of day)
- Physical scene setup (room layout, furniture, relevant props)

## Format
Write concise bullet points. Use present tense. Describe only the current state. Do NOT use headings, section titles, markdown formatting, or categories - just a flat list of bullet points.

## Response Format
Output ONLY plain bullet points (using - or *). No headings, no bold text, no categories, no markdown. Just simple bullet points listing the staging details.
