#### How CreativeWriter Feeds Context to AI
CreativeWriter uses a sophisticated context-building system when generating AI suggestions for beats. The system includes a standard prompt that defines the AI's role as a "creative writing assistant". Then it incorporates scene summaries (to reduce context size) from all previous scenes you've already written. You can either write the scene summary on your own, or let the AI create one for you. Additionally, you can choose to include the full text of specific scenes instead of the summary if you want; for example when you write a retrospective on a specific scene.

After the "story context", it includes the "codex" - all of your characters, items, and lore. The final part is the particular task for the next beat with additional instructions.

AI tends to "understand" XML-tags better than simple text as context structuring, so the system creates a pseudo-XML structure with this information in the prompt.

## 🏗️ Architecture

CreativeWriter is built with modern web technologies:

- **Frontend**: Angular 20 with Ionic 8 for responsive UI
- **Editor**: ProseMirror for rich text editing
- **Database**: PouchDB with CouchDB sync capability
- **AI Services**: Modular integration with multiple AI providers
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with nginx reverse proxy

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Persistent Storage Required!

> **WARNING: Without persistent volume mounting, you WILL lose ALL your stories when the Docker container restarts!**
> 
> The database MUST be mounted to a persistent directory on your host system. The default configuration uses `./data` for storage.
> 
> **Never run CreativeWriter without ensuring the data directory exists and is properly mounted!**

### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Create directory AND persistent storage
mkdir creativewriter && cd creativewriter

# CRITICAL: Create data directory for database persistence
mkdir -p data
chmod 755 data

# Download docker-compose configuration
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoDroll/creativewriter-public/main/docker-compose.yml

# Start with persistent storage
docker compose up -d

# Verify data persistence is working
ls -la ./data/couchdb-data/  # Should contain database files after first run

# Access at http://localhost:3080
```

### Environment Variables

The Docker Compose setup supports several environment variables that can be configured via a `.env` file in the project root:

- `PORT`: The port on which the application will be accessible (default: `3080`)
- `TZ`: Timezone setting for the containers (default: `Europe/Berlin`)
- `DATA_PATH`: Custom path for persistent data storage (default: `./data`)
- `COUCHDB_USER`: CouchDB admin username (default: `admin`)
- `COUCHDB_PASSWORD`: CouchDB admin password (default: `password` - **change in production!**)
- `COUCHDB_SECRET`: CouchDB secret key (default: `mysecret` - **change in production!**)

Create a `.env` file to customize these values:
```bash
PORT=3080
TZ=America/New_York
DATA_PATH=/custom/path/to/data
COUCHDB_USER=admin
COUCHDB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
COUCHDB_SECRET=your_secure_secret
```

### Configuration

#### AI Providers
Configure your AI providers in the application settings:
- **OpenRouter**: Add your API key for access to multiple models
- **Google Gemini**: Direct integration with Gemini models
- **Ollama (New!)**: Connect to local LLMs for complete privacy and offline usage
- **Custom Endpoints**: Support for self-hosted models

##### Ollama Setup (Local AI)
1. **Install Ollama**: https://ollama.com/
2. **Configure CORS** (required for web access):
   ```bash
   # Set environment variable to allow web access
   export OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"
   # Or for more security, specify your CreativeWriter URL:
   # export OLLAMA_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3080"
   ```
   
   **Alternative methods:**
   - **Linux/macOS**: Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`
   - **Windows**: Set via System Properties → Environment Variables
   - **Docker**: Add `-e OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"` to your Ollama container
   - **Systemd**: Edit `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service` and add `Environment="OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*"`

3. **Start Ollama** and run a model:
   ```bash
   ollama serve  # Start the server (if not auto-started)
   ollama run llama3.2  # Download and run a model
   ```

4. **Configure in CreativeWriter**:
   - Go to Settings → AI Providers → Ollama
   - Set URL (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
   - Test connection and select your model

**⚠️ CORS Troubleshooting:**
If you see "CORS" errors in browser console, ensure `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` is set correctly and restart Ollama.

#### Database
The application uses PouchDB for local storage with optional CouchDB sync:
- Local-only mode works out of the box
- For sync, configure CouchDB connection in settings

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT - Data Persistence:** The database requires a persistent volume mount to preserve your stories across container restarts. **Without proper volume mounting, you WILL lose all your data when the container stops!** The default docker-compose.yml already includes this configuration, but make sure the `./data` directory exists and has proper permissions.

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- ~500MB-1GB RAM per instance
- Port 3080 available (or configure a different port)
- **Persistent storage location for database** (default: `./data` directory)

### 📁 Data Persistence & Backup

**Critical: Your stories are stored in CouchDB within the Docker container.** The docker-compose.yml file maps the following volumes:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data/couchdb-data:/opt/couchdb/data     # Database files
  - ./data/log/couchdb_log:/opt/couchdb/var/log  # Log files
```

#### To ensure data safety:

1. **Never run without volumes:** Always use the provided docker-compose.yml
2. **Backup regularly:** Copy the `./data` directory to a safe location
3. **Custom data location:** Set a different path via environment variable:
   ```bash
   echo "DATA_PATH=/path/to/your/storage" >> .env
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. **Verify persistence:** Check that `./data/couchdb-data` contains files after first run
5. **Use the built-in backup feature:** Go to Settings → Backup & Restore to create downloadable backups

## 🦭 Podman Deployment

For users who prefer **Podman** over Docker, CreativeWriter supports deployment using **Podman Quadlet** with systemd integration.

### Key Differences from Docker Compose

| Aspect | Docker Compose | Podman Quadlet |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Networking** | Bridge network between containers | Single Pod with shared localhost |
| **Service Management** | `docker compose up/down` | `systemctl --user start/stop` |
| **Auto-start** | Requires daemon or restart policy | Native systemd service management |
| **Privileges** | Typically requires root | Fully rootless |
| **Port Configuration** | Edit compose file | Template units (`@PORT.target`) |

### Benefits

- **Rootless**: No root privileges required
- **Systemd integration**: Standard service management, auto-restart, and boot persistence
- **Single Pod architecture**: All containers share localhost, simplifying inter-service communication
- **Parameterized ports**: Run multiple instances on different ports using systemd template units

### Prerequisites

- Podman 4.4+ with Quadlet support
- systemd (user session)
- User lingering enabled: `loginctl enable-linger $USER`

### Documentation

For complete installation and configuration instructions, see **[docs/podman-quadlet.md](docs/podman-quadlet.md)**.

For a comparison of all deployment methods (Docker Compose, Podman, Unraid), see the **[Deployment Options Guide](docs/deployment-guide.md)**.

## 📝 Usage Tips

1. **Start with Story Structure**: Define your acts and chapters before diving into scenes
2. **Build Your Codex**: Add characters and locations early for better AI context
3. **Use Beat AI**: Let AI help with writer's block on individual beats
4. **📸 Leverage Visual Storytelling**: Embed images directly within your text to enhance scenes, character descriptions, or provide visual inspiration
5. **Experiment with Beat Versions**: Try different AI generations and restore previous versions using the version history feature
6. **Customize Prompts**: Tailor AI responses to your writing style
7. **Regular Exports**: Backup your work regularly using export features
